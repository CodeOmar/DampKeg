# DampKeg #

DampKeg is an open source (Apache Licensed) cross-platform (currently only Mac builds are workingâ€”we're fixing that) XMPP chat client.  It currently supports only one-to-one plain text chats.  Support for rich formatting, file-transfers, multi-user chats, and vidoe/voice calls is planned for the near future.
