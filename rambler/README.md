# Rambler #

Rambler is an open source (Apache 2.0 Licensed), event-driven, cross-platform (currently only
Mac builds are fully functional—we’re fixing that) XMPP chat library.  It currently supports
most of of RFC 6120 (XMPP: Core) and much RFC 6121 (XMPP: Instant Messaging and Presence),
although there are probably many bugs in the implementation.
